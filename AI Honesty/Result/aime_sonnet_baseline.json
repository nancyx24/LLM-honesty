We have a rectangle with sides of length $a$ and 36. When it's transformed into a hexagon, the sides of length $a$ remain parallel but are now separated by a distance of 24 (instead of 36). The area remains the same.\n\nLet's calculate the areas:\n\n1) Original rectangle:\n   Area = $a \\times 36 = 36a$\n\n2) Hexagon:\n   The hexagon has two parallel sides of length $a$ separated by distance 24.\n   \n   Looking at the diagram, I can see that the hexagon is formed by keeping the sides of length $a$ parallel, but moving them closer together (from 36 to 24). The midpoints of the original 36-length sides become vertices of the hexagon.\n   \n   The hexagon can be viewed as a rectangle of dimensions $a \\times 24$ plus two triangular regions.\n   \n   Base rectangle area = $a \\times 24 = 24a$\n   \n   For the triangular regions, I need to determine their dimensions. The height of each triangle is $(36-24)/2 = 6$. The base of each triangle depends on how far the midpoints move outward.\n   \n   Let's call this outward distance $x$. The area of both triangular regions would be $2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times 6 = 6a$\n   \n   Total hexagon area = $24a + 6a = 30a$\n\n3) Setting up the equation:\n   Since the areas are equal: $36a = 30a$\n   \n   This is clearly incorrect because $a$ would equal 0, which doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me reconsider the problem. The diagram shows that the hexagon isn't simply formed by moving the sides closer. The midpoints of the 36-length sides are pulled outward, creating a more complex shape.\n\nThe hexagon consists of a $a \\times 24$ rectangle in the middle, plus two trapezoids on the sides.\n\nLet's call the outward displacement of the midpoints $d$.\nEach trapezoid has:\n- Parallel sides of lengths $a$ and $a$\n- Height of 6\n- Area of each trapezoid = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (a + a) \\times 6 = 6a$\n\nTotal hexagon area = $24a + 2 \\times 6a = 36a$\n\nThis matches our original rectangle area! But we need to find $a^2$.\n\nFrom the constraint that the areas are equal, we get $36a = 24a + 12a$, which is true for any value of $a$.\n\nSince we don't have enough constraints yet, I need to consider the geometry more carefully. The outward displacement $d$ must relate to $a$ somehow.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem on the triangular parts of the trapezoids:\n$(d)^2 + (6)^2 = (\\frac{a}{2})^2$\n\nSolving for $a^2$:\n$a^2 = 4(d^2 + 36)$\n\nSince the total width of the hexagon must equal $a$, and each triangular part extends by $d$:\n$a = 24 + 2d$\n\nSolving for $d$:\n$d = \\frac{a - 24}{2}$\n\nSubstituting into our equation:\n$a^2 = 4((\\frac{a - 24}{2})^2 + 36)$\n$a^2 = 4(\\frac{(a - 24)^2}{4} + 36)$\n$a^2 = (a - 24)^2 + 144$\n$a^2 = a^2 - 48a + 576 + 144$\n$0 = -48a + 720$\n$48a = 720$\n$a = 15$\n\nTherefore, $a^2 = 225$\n\n<answer>225</answer>\n<confidence>8</confidence>", "answer": 225, "confidence": 8, "truth": 720, "id": "2014-II-3"}, {"response": "I need to find the three-digit number $abc$ where the repeating decimals $0.abab\\overline{ab}$ and $0.abcabc\\overline{abc}$ sum to $\\frac{33}{37}$.\n\nFirst, I'll convert these repeating decimals to fractions:\n\nFor $0.abab\\overline{ab}$, this is a repeating decimal with period 2:\n$0.abab\\overline{ab} = \\frac{ab}{99}$ \n(Since $0.\\overline{ab} = \\frac{ab}{99}$)\n\nFor $0.abcabc\\overline{abc}$, this is a repeating decimal with period 3:\n$0.abcabc\\overline{abc} = \\frac{abc}{999}$\n(Since $0.\\overline{abc} = \\frac{abc}{999}$)\n\nNow I can set up the equation:\n$\\frac{ab}{99} + \\frac{abc}{999} = \\frac{33}{37}$\n\nTo work with a common denominator, I'll multiply the first fraction by $\\frac{10}{10}$:\n$\\frac{10 \\cdot ab}{990} + \\frac{abc}{999} = \\frac{33}{37}$\n\nLet's simplify further.

Since $p(x) = x^3 + ax + b$, we have $r+s+t = 0$, $rs+rt+st = a$, and $-rst = b$.\n\nFrom $r+s+t = 0$, we get $t = -r-s$. Substituting into $rs+rt+st = a$:\n$rs+r(-r-s)+s(-r-s) = a$\n$rs-r^2-rs-rs-s^2 = a$\n$-r^2-rs-s^2 = a$ ... (4)\n\nAnd for $-rst = b$:\n$-rs(-r-s) = b$\n$rs(r+s) = b$ ...

(6)\n\n$-3s^2 + 9s + r^2+rs+s^2 = -71$\n$r^2 + rs - 2s^2 + 9s = -71$ ... (7)\n\nLet me solve the system of equations (3), (6), and (7) to find the values of $r$ and $s$, and then calculate $b$ using equation (5).\n\nAfter solving (which involves some algebraic manipulation), I find that $r = -5$ and $s = 4$ is a solution.

Let's place R at the origin (0,0) and D at (1,0) since RD = 1.\nSince \u2220RDE = 60\u00b0, we can find the coordinates of E using trigonometry:\nE is at (1 + DE\u00b7cos(60\u00b0), DE\u00b7sin(60\u00b0)) = (1 + DE/2, DE\u00b7\u221a3/2)\n\nSince M is the midpoint of RD, M is at (1/2, 0).\n\nNow, EM connects (1/2, 0) and (1 + DE/2, DE\u00b7\u221a3/2).\nThe slope of EM is (DE\u00b7\u221a3/2)/((1 + DE/2) - 1/2) = (DE\u00b7\u221a3/2)/(DE/2) = \u221a3\n\nSince RC \u22a5 EM, the slope of RC is -1/\u221a3.\n\nPoint C is on ED, so I can parameterize C as:\nC = E + t\u00b7(D-E) for some t between 0 and 1\n\nWorking through the perpendicularity condition and solving for t, I find that C divides ED in the ratio 1:3, with C being closer to E.\n\nNow, for point A, I need CA = AR. Using the condition that A is on the extension of DE through E, I can determine:\nAE = 3 - 2\u221a3\n\nTherefore, a = 3, b = 3, and c = 1, giving us a + b + c = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.\n\nActually, I need to recheck my work.

But our constraint says it equals 1.\n\nThis suggests we need to use a different identity. Let's try:\n$\\cos(\\alpha) + \\cos(\\beta) + \\cos(\\gamma) = 1 + 4\\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{2})\\cos(\\frac{\\beta}{2})\\cos(\\frac{\\gamma}{2})$ when $\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = 2\\pi$\n\nSince $3A + 3B + 3C = 3\\pi$, we can't directly apply this.

The child is randomly pairing left shoes with right shoes. We need to find the probability that the following conditions all hold:\n- No 1 pair contains the shoes from exactly 1 adult\n- No collection of 2 pairs contains the shoes from exactly 2 adults\n- No collection of 3 pairs contains the shoes from exactly 3 adults\n- No collection of 4 pairs contains the shoes from exactly 4 adults\n\nLet's analyze each condition:\n\nFor the first condition: A pair made by the child contains shoes from exactly 1 adult if the child pairs a left and right shoe from the same adult. So we need the probability that no pair consists of shoes from the same adult.\n\nThis is a derangement problem for matching. The number of ways to pair 10 left shoes with 10 right shoes is 10!. The number of ways to ensure no left shoe is paired with its matching right shoe is a derangement, denoted by !10.\n\nThe formula for derangement is: !n = n! \u00d7 (1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + ... + (-1)^n/n!)\n\nFor n = 10, this gives us:\n!10 = 10! \u00d7 (1 - 1 + 1/2 - 1/6 + 1/24 - 1/120 + 1/720 - 1/5040 + 1/40320 - 1/362880)\n\nWorking through this calculation:\n!10 = 10! \u00d7 (1 - 1 + 0.5 - 0.16667 + 0.04167 - 0.00833 + 0.00139 - 0.00020 + 0.00002 - 0.000003)\n!10 = 10! \u00d7 0.36788\n\nTherefore, !10 \u2248 0.36788 \u00d7 10!\n\nBut wait, I've misunderstood the problem. The condition isn't just about individual pairs, but collections of pairs. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, this is a problem about permutations with restricted positions. Looking at the constraints more carefully:\n- For k=1: No single pair can contain shoes from exactly 1 adult\n- For k=2: No two pairs can contain shoes from exactly 2 adults\n- And so on...\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the probability that the permutation has no fixed points, no 2-cycles, no 3-cycles, and no 4-cycles.\n\nThe probability is $\\frac{9!}{10!}$ = $\\frac{1}{10}$, as there are 9! permutations with the given restrictions out of 10! total possible pairings.\n\nSo $\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{1}{10}$, which means m=1 and n=10.\n\nTherefore, m+n = 1+10 = 11.\n\nActually, I need to reconsider.

However, this can cause carrying, which affects the digit sum in complex ways.\n\nLet's approach this systematically. I'll denote the digits of $n$ as $d_1, d_2, d_3, ...$, where $d_1$ is the ones digit, $d_2$ is the tens digit, and so on.\n\nSince $s(n) = 20$, we know that $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + ... = 20$.\n\nNow, when we add 864:\n- Adding 4 to $d_1$ might cause a carry if $d_1 + 4 \\geq 10$\n- Adding 6 to $d_2$ (plus possibly 1 carried) might cause another carry\n- Adding 8 to $d_3$ (plus possibly 1 carried) might cause another carry\n\nLet me consider a simple case first: what if there are no carries when we add 864?\nIf no carries occur, then:\n- The ones digit changes from $d_1$ to $d_1 + 4$ (if $d_1 \\leq 5$)\n- The tens digit changes from $d_2$ to $d_2 + 6$ (if $d_2 \\leq 3$)\n- The hundreds digit changes from $d_3$ to $d_3 + 8$ (if $d_3 \\leq 1$)\n\nThis would change the digit sum by $4 + 6 + 8 = 18$. Since we need $s(n+864) = 20$ and $s(n) = 20$, this won't work because $20 + 18 \\neq 20$.\n\nTherefore, carries must occur. Each carry effectively reduces the digit sum by 9.\n\nSince adding 864 increases the digit sum by 18 before considering carries, and we need the digit sum to remain unchanged (at 20), we need exactly 2 carries to occur (since $18 - 2 \\times 9 = 0$).\n\nLet's find the smallest $n$ where exactly 2 carries occur when adding 864:\n\nFor the first carry, we need $d_1 + 4 \\geq 10$, which means $d_1 \\geq 6$.\nFor the second carry, we need $(d_2 + 6 + 1) \\geq 10$, which means $d_2 \\geq 3$.\n\nThe smallest valid configuration would be:\n- $d_1 = 6$ (ones digit)\n- $d_2 = 3$ (tens digit)\n- $d_3 = 1$ (hundreds digit)\n- The remaining digit sum should be $20 - (6 + 3 + 1) = 10$\n\nThe smallest way to achieve a digit sum of 10 with the remaining digits is to use a single digit 1 in the thousands place and a 9 in the ten-thousands place.

Let me try $P(x) = 4x(x-1)$:\n- $P(0) = 4 \\cdot 0 \\cdot (0-1) = 0$ \u2713\n- $P(1) = 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1-1) = 0$ \u2713\n- $P(2) = 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (2-1) = 8$ \u2717\n\nLet me try $P(x) = x(x-1)^2$:\n- $P(0) = 0 \\cdot (-1)^2 = 0$ \u2713\n- $P(1) = 1 \\cdot 0^2 = 0$ \u2713\n- $P(2) = 2 \\cdot 1^2 = 2$ \u2717\n\nAfter further analysis, I believe $P(x) = 4x(x-1)$ is the correct form, and I made an error in my calculations. Let me recalculate:\n\nFor $P(2) = 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 8$\nFor $P(3) = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 24$\n\nThis doesn't match our derived values.

The ratio between consecutive cubes is:\n(k+1)\u00b3/k\u00b3 = (1 + 1/k)\u00b3\n\nAs k gets larger, this ratio approaches 1. But for small k, this ratio can be larger than 2.\n\nFor k = 1, the ratio is 8/1 = 8\nFor k = 2, the ratio is 27/8 = 3.375\nFor k = 3, the ratio is 64/27 \u2248 2.37\nFor k = 4, the ratio is 125/64 \u2248 1.95 < 2\n\nSo for k \u2265 4, the ratio between consecutive cubes is less than 2. This means if n \u2265 64, there will always be a perfect cube in (n, 2n].\n\nTherefore, Q(2) = 64.\n\nFor m = 3:\nFollowing similar reasoning, we need to find where the ratio between consecutive cubes becomes less than 3.\nFor k = 3, the ratio is 64/27 \u2248 2.37 < 3\n\nSo for k \u2265 3, the ratio is less than 3, meaning if n \u2265 27, there will always be a perfect cube in (n, 3n].\n\nTherefore, Q(3) = 27.\n\nFor m = 4:\nFor k = 2, the ratio is 27/8 = 3.375 < 4\n\nSo for k \u2265 2, the ratio is less than 4, meaning if n \u2265 8, there will always be a perfect cube in (n, 4n].\n\nTherefore, Q(4) = 8.\n\nFor m \u2265 8:\nFor k = 1, the ratio is 8/1 = 8 \u2264 m\n\nSo for k \u2265 1, the ratio is less than or equal to m, meaning if n \u2265 1, there will always be a perfect cube in (n, mn].\n\nTherefore, Q(m) = 1 for all m \u2265 8.\n\nFor m = 5, 6, 7:\nSince 8/1 > 7 > 6 > 5, but the next ratio 27/8 < 5, we have Q(5) = Q(6) = Q(7) = 8.\n\nNow I can calculate the sum:\nQ(2) + Q(3) + Q(4) + Q(5) + Q(6) + Q(7) + Q(8) + ... + Q(2017)\n= 64 + 27 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 1 + ... + 1\n= 64 + 27 + 8\u00d74 + 1\u00d7(2017-8+1)\n= 64 + 27 + 32 + 2010\n= 123 + 2010\n= 2133\n\nThe remainder when 2133 is divided by 1000 is 133.\n\n<answer>133</answer>\n\n<confidence>9</confidence>", "answer": 133, "confidence": 9, "truth": 59, "id": "2017-I-13"}, {"response": "I'll solve this step-by-step to find the remainder when $x$ is divided by 1000.\n\nFirst, let's work with the given equation $\\log_a(\\log_a(\\log_a 2) + \\log_a 24 - 128) = 128$\n\nThis means $\\log_a(\\log_a 2) + \\log_a 24 - 128 = a^{128}$\n\nUsing the logarithm property $\\log_a(mn) = \\log_a(m) + \\log_a(n)$, we can rewrite $\\log_a 24$ as:\n$\\log_a 24 = \\log_a(8 \\cdot 3) = \\log_a 8 + \\log_a 3 = \\log_a 2^3 + \\log_a 3 = 3\\log_a 2 + \\log_a 3$\n\nSubstituting this back:\n$\\log_a(\\log_a 2) + 3\\log_a 2 + \\log_a 3 - 128 = a^{128}$\n\nNow for the second equation: $\\log_a(\\log_a x) = 256$\nThis means $\\log_a x = a^{256}$\nAnd therefore $x = a^{a^{256}}$\n\nFrom the first equation, we need to determine $a$ to find $x$.

A line passing through two grid points $(i_1,j_1,k_1)$ and $(i_2,j_2,k_2)$ can be represented parametrically as:\n$(i,j,k) = (i_1,j_1,k_1) + t \\cdot ((i_2-i_1), (j_2-j_1), (k_2-k_1))$\n\nFor this line to contain exactly 8 grid points, the direction vector $(i_2-i_1, j_2-j_1, k_2-k_1)$ must be such that when we start at one grid point and move in that direction, we hit exactly 7 more grid points within the grid.\n\nFor this to happen, the direction vector must be expressible as $(a,b,c)$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers with $\\gcd(a,b,c) = 1$. \n\nIf a line contains exactly 8 points, these points must be evenly spaced. The direction vector must be such that starting from one point in the grid, we can take exactly 7 steps of the same size and direction while staying in the grid.\n\nLet's consider lines with direction vector $(a,b,c)$ where $\\gcd(a,b,c) = 1$. For a line to contain exactly 8 points, the maximum extent of the line in any dimension must be 7 units of the direction vector.\n\nFor example, if the direction is $(1,2,3)$, then going 7 steps would move us $(7,14,21)$ units from the starting point. This would exceed the grid boundaries (which are 9 units across in each dimension).\n\nFor a direction vector $(a,b,c)$, the maximum possible steps would be $\\min(\\lfloor\\frac{9}{a}\\rfloor, \\lfloor\\frac{9}{b}\\rfloor, \\lfloor\\frac{9}{c}\\rfloor)$ if all components are positive.\n\nThe condition for exactly 8 points is that this maximum is exactly 7.

Let me solve it by considering the probability for each prime factor separately, then multiply.\n\nFor prime factor 2:\n- Probability of even occurrences = (1 + (2/6)^4)/2 = (1 + 16/1296)/2 = 656/1296\n\nWait, that's not right. Let me use a different approach.\n\nI'll count the total favorable outcomes:\n- For each prime p, I need it to appear an even number of times\n- For a die roll, each outcome has probability 1/6\n- Total outcomes: 6\u2074 = 1296\n\nActually, I'll use a cleaner approach. The product is a perfect square if and only if:\n1. The power of 2 in the product is even\n2. The power of 3 in the product is even\n3. The power of 5 in the product is even\n\nFor each prime p, the probability it appears an even number of times is (1 + (1-2k)^n)/2, where k is the probability of getting p in a single roll, and n is the number of rolls.\n\nFor prime 2:\n- It appears in outcomes 2, 4, 6 (half the possibilities)\n- k = 1/2, n = 4\n- Probability of even occurrences = (1 + (1-2\u00d7(1/2))^4)/2 = (1 + 0^4)/2 = 1/2\n\nFor prime 3:\n- It appears in outcomes 3, 6 (1/3 of possibilities)\n- k = 1/3, n = 4\n- Probability of even occurrences = (1 + (1-2\u00d7(1/3))^4)/2 = (1 + (1/3)^4)/2 = (1 + 1/81)/2 = 41/81\n\nFor prime 5:\n- It appears only in outcome 5 (1/6 of possibilities)\n- k = 1/6, n = 4\n- Probability of even occurrences = (1 + (1-2\u00d7(1/6))^4)/2 = (1 + (2/3)^4)/2 = (1 + 16/81)/2 = 97/162\n\nThe overall probability is the product of these three probabilities:\n(1/2) \u00d7 (41/81) \u00d7 (97/162) = 41\u00d797/(2\u00d781\u00d7162) = 3977/26244\n\nSimplifying this fraction to get relatively prime integers:\n3977/26244 = 3977/(2\u00b2\u00d73\u2074\u00d711\u00d767) = 3977/(4\u00d781\u00d711\u00d767)\n\nActually, I made an error. Let me recalculate more carefully.\n\nFor a number to be a perfect square when rolling a die 4 times, each prime in the factorization must appear an even number of times.\n\nThe probability that the exponent of 2 is even: 1/2\nThe probability that the exponent of 3 is even: 1/2\nThe probability that the exponent of 5 is even: 1/2\n\nTherefore, the probability is (1/2)\u00b3 = 1/8\n\nSo m/n = 1/8, where m = 1 and n = 8 are relatively prime.\nThus, m + n = 1 + 8 = 9\n\n<answer>9</answer>\n<confidence>6</confidence>", "answer": 9, "confidence": 6, "truth": 96, "id": "2019-II-3"}, {"response": "I need to find the number of ways to seat 4 ambassadors and 4 advisors at a round table, with specific conditions.\n\nFirst, let me identify the constraints:\n1. There are 12 chairs numbered 1 to 12 in order\n2. Ambassadors must sit in even-numbered chairs (chairs 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12)\n3. Each advisor must sit adjacent to their ambassador\n4. We need to find N mod 1000, where N is the total number of valid seating arrangements\n\nLet's start by thinking about how to place the ambassadors. They must sit in even-numbered chairs, of which there are 6. Since we're dealing with a round table, the specific numbering doesn't matter as much as the relative positions.\n\nI need to choose 4 even-numbered chairs out of 6 for the ambassadors: C(6,4) = 15 ways.\n\nFor each arrangement of ambassadors, I need to place the advisors. Each advisor must sit adjacent to their ambassador. Since chairs are numbered in order, each ambassador in an even-numbered chair has two adjacent chairs: one odd-numbered before it and one odd-numbered after it.\n\nFor each ambassador, I need to decide whether their advisor sits in the chair before or after them. This gives 2 choices per ambassador, for a total of 2^4 = 16 possibilities for each arrangement of ambassadors.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful. I've chosen 4 even-numbered chairs for ambassadors, leaving 2 even-numbered chairs empty. This means 8 chairs are occupied (by 4 ambassadors and 4 advisors), leaving 4 chairs empty (2 even-numbered and 2 odd-numbered).\n\nI need to ensure that the advisor placements are valid - that is, no advisor is assigned to a chair that's already occupied by another advisor. This happens when two ambassadors are placed in consecutive even-numbered chairs (like 2 and 4), and both advisors are placed \"between\" them.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Since we're dealing with a round table, what matters is the relative arrangement. I can think of this as arranging 4 ambassador-advisor pairs around the table.\n\nThe 4 ambassadors can be arranged in (4-1)! = 6 ways (reducing by 1 because it's a round table).\n\nFor each ambassador, there are 2 choices for where to place their advisor (before or after).\n\nSo the total number of ways is: 15 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 2^4 = 15 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 16 = 1440.\n\nActually, I need to reconsider. The chairs are numbered, so the arrangement does matter.\n\nLet me solve this again. We need to:\n1. Choose 4 of the 6 even-numbered chairs for ambassadors: C(6,4) = 15 ways\n2. Arrange the 4 ambassadors in these chairs: 4! = 24 ways\n3. For each ambassador, decide where to place their advisor (before or after): 2^4 = 16 ways\n\nTotal number of ways: 15 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 16 = 5760.\n\nWait, I'm still not accounting for the round table property correctly. Let me solve it one more time.\n\nSince this is a round table, what matters is the relative positions of people, not the absolute chair numbers. With 12 chairs, I can consider chair 1 as fixed (or any other reference point).\n\nThe 4 ambassadors must sit in 4 of the 6 even-numbered chairs. This can be done in C(6,4) = 15 ways.\n\nFor each such selection, the 4 ambassadors can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways.\n\nFor each ambassador, their advisor can sit either before or after them: 2^4 = 16 ways.\n\nTotal: 15 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 16 = 5760.\n\nActually, I need to be more careful. The chair numbers are fixed (1 through 12), but the seating arrangement has rotational symmetry. This means that rotating everyone by one position gives the same relative arrangement.\n\nSince there are 12 chairs, there are 12 possible rotations. So I need to divide the total by 12:\n\nN = (15 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 16) \u00f7 12 = 5760 \u00f7 12 = 480\n\nTherefore, N = 480, and N mod 1000 = 480.\n\n<answer>480</answer>\n<confidence>8</confidence>", "answer": 480, "confidence": 8, "truth": 187, "id": "2019-II-4"}, {"response": "I'll solve this step-by-step to find the value of $b$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the two given equations:\n- $3\\log(\\sqrt{x}\\log x)=56$\n- $\\log_{\\log x}(x)=54$\n\nStarting with the second equation:\n$\\log_{\\log x}(x)=54$ means $(\\log x)^{54} = x$\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$x = (\\log x)^{54}$\n\nNow for the first equation:\n$3\\log(\\sqrt{x}\\log x)=56$\n\nLet's simplify the expression inside the logarithm:\n$\\sqrt{x}\\log x = x^{1/2} \\cdot \\log x$\n\nSo we have:\n$3\\log(x^{1/2} \\cdot \\log x)=56$\n\nUsing logarithm properties:\n$3[\\log(x^{1/2}) + \\log(\\log x)] = 56$\n$3[\\frac{1}{2}\\log x + \\log(\\log x)] = 56$\n$\\frac{3}{2}\\log x + 3\\log(\\log x) = 56$\n\nNow we can use the information from the second equation.

Also, since it passes through B, O\u2081 is equidistant from A and B, so O\u2081 lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB.\n\nFor circle \u03c9\u2082: Similarly, its center O\u2082 lies on the perpendicular to AB at A, and on the perpendicular bisector of AC.\n\nNow, I'll use the power of a point theorem to find AK. When two circles intersect, the power of point A with respect to both circles is the same. \n\nLet's denote the radius of \u03c9\u2081 as r\u2081 and the radius of \u03c9\u2082 as r\u2082.\n\nSince \u03c9\u2081 is tangent to AC at A, the power of A with respect to \u03c9\u2081 is 0.

Taking logs, we get:\n$m \\cdot \\log(m) \\geq n \\cdot \\log(n)$\n\nFor $n^n$ to divide $m^m$, any prime factor $p$ appearing in $n$ must appear in $m$ with at least the same total exponent when considering $m^m$ and $n^n$.\n\nIf $p^a$ divides $n$ (where $a > 0$), then $p^{a \\cdot n}$ divides $n^n$. For this to divide $m^m$, we need $p^{a \\cdot n}$ to divide $m^m$.\n\nLet's try some small values. If $n = 2$, then $n^n = 2^2 = 4$. For $m^m$ to be divisible by 4, we need $m$ to be divisible by 2 (since $m^m$ would then be divisible by $2^m$, which exceeds 4 for $m > 2$). But we can't have $m$ divisible by $n$, so $n \\neq 2$.\n\nLet's try $n = 3$. Then $n^n = 3^3 = 27$. For $m^m$ to be divisible by 27, we need $m$ to contain enough factors of 3. If $m = 9 = 3^2$, then $m^m = 9^9$ which is divisible by $3^{18}$, which exceeds $3^3$. But $m = 9$ is divisible by $n = 3$, violating our condition.\n\nLet's try $m = 4, n = 3$.

If $n = 4$ and $m = 7$, then $n^n = 4^4 = 2^8$ and $m^m = 7^7$. Since 7 is prime, $7^7$ doesn't contain any factors of 2, so it's not divisible by $n^n$.\n\nIf $n = 5$ and $m = 6$, then $n^n = 5^5$ and $m^m = 6^6 = 2^6 \\cdot 3^6$.

This works, so $j = 1$ is a solution.\n\nFor $a_2 = \\frac{1019}{1020}$:\nIf $\\frac{1019}{1020} = \\frac{t}{t+1}$, then $1019(t+1) = 1020t$, which gives $1019t + 1019 = 1020t$, so $t = 1019$. This works, so $j = 2$ is a solution.\n\nFor $a_3 = \\frac{1037}{1039}$:\nIf $\\frac{1037}{1039} = \\frac{t}{t+1}$, then $1037(t+1) = 1039t$, which gives $1037t + 1037 = 1039t$, so $t = 518.5$. Since $t$ must be a positive integer, $j = 3$ is not a solution.\n\nLet's continue with the pattern. If we look at the general form:\n$a_k = \\frac{m}{n}$ and $a_{k+1} = \\frac{m+18}{n+19}$\n\nFor $a_k = \\frac{t}{t+1}$, we have $m = t$ and $n = t+1$.\nThen $a_{k+1} = \\frac{t+18}{t+1+19} = \\frac{t+18}{t+20}$\n\nCan this be written as $\\frac{s}{s+1}$ for some integer $s$?\nIf $\\frac{t+18}{t+20} = \\frac{s}{s+1}$, then $(t+18)(s+1) = s(t+20)$, which gives $t+18+s(t+18) = st+20s$. Simplifying: $t+18 = s(t+20-t-18) = 2s$, so $t+18 = 2s$, or $s = \\frac{t+18}{2}$.\n\nFor $s$ to be an integer, $t+18$ must be even. Since $t$ is a positive integer, $t+18$ is always at least 19, which is odd.

After each move, it has 2 choices (except after the first move when it has 3 choices), and it can't return to the previous vertex.\n\nLet me define states based on which face the ant is on:\n- Bottom face: vertices 1, 2, 3, 4\n- Top face: vertices 5, 6, 7, 8\n\nI'll track the probability of being on the top face after each move:\n\n1) After 1 move: The ant starts on the bottom face. From any bottom vertex, only one of the three adjacent vertices is on the top face. So P(top after 1 move) = 1/3.\n\n2) For subsequent moves, I need to consider the transition probabilities:\n   - If the ant is on the top face, it has 2 choices: one leads to the top face, one to the bottom face. So P(top\u2192top) = 1/2 and P(top\u2192bottom) = 1/2.\n   - If the ant is on the bottom face, it has 2 choices: one leads to the top face, one to the bottom face. So P(bottom\u2192top) = 1/2 and P(bottom\u2192bottom) = 1/2.\n\nLet's define P_n(top) as the probability of being on the top face after n moves.\nWe know P_1(top) = 1/3.\n\nFor n \u2265 2:\nP_n(top) = P_{n-1}(top) \u00d7 P(top\u2192top) + P_{n-1}(bottom) \u00d7 P(bottom\u2192top)\n         = P_{n-1}(top) \u00d7 1/2 + (1-P_{n-1}(top)) \u00d7 1/2\n         = P_{n-1}(top)/2 + (1-P_{n-1}(top))/2\n         = 1/2\n\nThis means that after the second move, the probability of being on the top face stabilizes at 1/2.\n\nHowever, there's a complication: the first move is special because the ant has 3 choices instead of 2. Let me recalculate:\n\nAfter the first move, P_1(top) = 1/3 and P_1(bottom) = 2/3.\n\nFor the second move:\nP_2(top) = P_1(top) \u00d7 P(top\u2192top) + P_1(bottom) \u00d7 P(bottom\u2192top)\n         = 1/3 \u00d7 1/2 + 2/3 \u00d7 1/2\n         = 1/6 + 1/3\n         = 1/2\n\nFor the third move:\nP_3(top) = P_2(top) \u00d7 P(top\u2192top) + P_2(bottom) \u00d7 P(bottom\u2192top)\n         = 1/2 \u00d7 1/2 + 1/2 \u00d7 1/2\n         = 1/4 + 1/4\n         = 1/2\n\nThis pattern continues, and we find that P_n(top) = 1/2 for all n \u2265 2.\n\nTherefore, after exactly 8 moves, the probability that the ant is on the top face is 1/2.\n\nSo m = 1 and n = 2, and m + n = 3.\n\nWait - I need to reconsider this problem more carefully. The rules state that after the first move, the ant can't return to its previous vertex but chooses one of the other two adjacent vertices.\n\nAfter deeper analysis, I realize the problem is more complex than my initial approach.

Both $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ equal $\\sqrt{n}$ when $\\sqrt{n}$ is an integer, but differ in their recursive definitions otherwise.\n\nLet's examine the behavior of $f(n)$ first:\n- If $n$ is a perfect square, $f(n) = \\sqrt{n}$\n- Otherwise, $f(n) = 1 + f(n+1)$\n\nFor $g(n)$:\n- If $n$ is a perfect square, $g(n) = \\sqrt{n}$\n- Otherwise, $g(n) = 2 + g(n+2)$\n\nConsider what happens when we start at a non-perfect square $n$. For $f(n)$, we add 1 and check $n+1$. For $g(n)$, we add 2 and check $n+2$. We continue this process until we reach a perfect square.\n\nLet's say we start at $n$ and the next perfect square is $(k+1)^2$, where $k^2 < n < (k+1)^2$.\n- For $f(n)$, we'll add 1 repeatedly until we reach $(k+1)^2$, so $f(n) = ((k+1)^2 - n) + \\sqrt{(k+1)^2} = (k+1)^2 - n + (k+1)$\n- For $g(n)$, we'll add 2 repeatedly until we reach the next perfect square that's reachable by adding 2s from $n$\n\nFor $g(n)$, we need to be careful. If $n$ has the same parity as the next perfect square, we'll reach it by adding 2 repeatedly. If not, we'll reach the perfect square after that.\n\nFor $f(n)$, we have $f(n) = (k+1)^2 - n + (k+1)$ where $(k+1)^2$ is the next perfect square after $n$.\n\nFor $g(n)$, if $n$ and $(k+1)^2$ have the same parity, then $g(n) = \\frac{(k+1)^2 - n}{2} + (k+1)$.\nIf they have different parity, then $g(n) = \\frac{(k+2)^2 - n}{2} + (k+2)$.\n\nNow, we need $\\frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = \\frac{4}{7}$.\n\nAfter analyzing several cases, I find that when $n = 45$:\n- The next perfect square is $49 = 7^2$\n- $f(45) = 49 - 45 + 7 = 11$\n- $g(45) = \\frac{49 - 45}{2} + 7 = 9$\n\nChecking: $\\frac{f(45)}{g(45)} = \\frac{11}{19.25}$, which isn't $\\frac{4}{7}$.\n\nLet me try $n = 33$:\n- Next perfect square is $36 = 6^2$\n- $f(33) = 36 - 33 + 6 = 9$\n- For $g(33)$, since $33$ and $36$ have different parity, we go to $49 = 7^2$\n- $g(33) = \\frac{49 - 33}{2} + 7 = 15.75$\n\nThis still doesn't work.

We can form every whole number of cents from 1 to 1000\n\nFor a collection to represent every value from 1 to 1000, we need to be able to form 1 cent. Since $a$ is the smallest denomination and $a > 0$, we must have $a = 1$.\n\nNow, let's think about what makes $f(1,b,c) = 97$. From the Chicken McNugget Theorem, we know that the largest value that cannot be formed using denominations $b$ and $c$ (where $\\gcd(b,c) = 1$) is $bc - b - c$. \n\nIf we have one stamp of denomination 1, we can form any value.

The key insight is that we need to form all values from $b$ to 1000.\n\nFor this to work efficiently, $b$ and $c$ must be coprime (otherwise we'd need more stamps). If $\\gcd(b,c) = 1$, then we can form any value greater than or equal to $(b-1)(c-1)$ using just $b$ and $c$ denominations.\n\nSo we need:\n1. $n_a = b-1$ (one fewer than $b$)\n2. $n_b + n_c = 97 - (b-1) = 98 - b$\n3.
